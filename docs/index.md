### open3DCV
open3DCV is a Multiple View Geometry library developed by [Kai Wu](https://imkaywu.github.io/) for efficient and reliable implementation of MVG algorithms. The goal is to provide a lightweight implementation with minimum dependencies. This library implements many widely used vision algorithms, which includes

* feature detection and description extraction
* feature matching
* relative pose estimation
	* seven-point algorithm for Fundamental matrix
	* eight-point algorithm for Fundamental matrix
	* five-point algoirthm for Essential matrix
* triangulation
* RANSAC framework

### Implementation
The implementation of various algorithms have been organized into a list of blog posts. Please visit the [vision tutorial](https://imkaywu.github.io/tutorials/vision/) page for more details.
