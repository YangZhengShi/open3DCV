## Introduction
open3DCV is a simple, lightweight 3D computer vision library with minimum third-party dependencies. This library includes implementations of many widely used Multiple View Geometry algorithms, some highlights are as follow. Please visit the [website](https://imkaywu.github.io/open3DCV/) for more details. Tutorials on the implementation are [here](https://imkaywu.github.io/tutorials/open3dcv/). More to come~

* Pinhole camera model
* Feature detector, descriptor extraction
* Feature Matching
* Estimation of Fundamental Matrix (7-point, 8-point, robust estimation with RANSAC)
* Estimation of Essential Matrix (5-point)
* N-view triangulation
* A general RANSAC framework
* Sequential Structure from Motion (SfM)
